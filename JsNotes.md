# Javascript Notes
to learn: 
- [ ] dom manip
- [ ] async
- [ ] api stuff
- [ ] React

## Intro
- Javascript is a dynamic lang that runs on both browsers(Spidermonkey and v8) and also outside the browser in the node runtime environment
- Standardised by ECMA and standard is called ECMAscript

## Bestpractices
- If your writing js in the html file itself then write it in the bottom most part of the body tag, that way the html content is loaded first and the script proccessed after that plus we actually need some elements to work(manip) with first.
- Use Camel notation to name identifiers eg. firstName
- Whenever in doubt use [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Basics
- all **statements** need to be terminated by `;` in js
- Except statements ending with blocks:
```js
function foo() {
// ...
}
if (y >0) {
// Â·Â·Â·
}
```
- Code without semicolons is legal but not preferred
- comment is made by using `//`

## Operators 
### Comparison operators
- a == b : Loose equality (doesn't check types) 
- a != b : loose inequality
- a === b : strict equality (checks for same type)
- a !== b : strict inequality
- a < b / a > b / a >= b / a <= b : greater than and less than
> Note: There's no strict greater than/ less than operator

### Logical Operators
- expr1 && expr2 : And operator
- expr1 || expr2 : Or operator
- !expr : Not operator	

### Variables
- Define a variable using the `let` keyword
```js
let x;
console.log(x);

let y = 2;
y = 'hi'
console.log(y);
``` 
- This will print undefined and hi in the console
- Variables can be undefined in js and be defined later in the code
- Identifier names can't start with a number and -

### Constants
- Constants as their names suggest are variables that have a fixed value and can't be reassigned
```js
const pi = 3.1459;
console.log(pi);
```

## Data types
- Primitives | Reference types

### Primitives
- string, number, bool(true/false), undefined, null
```js
let name = 'Suraj'; //string
let age = 69; //number
let feelingGood = true; //bool
let purposeInLife; //undefined
let energyMeter = null; //null
```

- the type of an object can be checked by using `typeof object` eg. `typeof name => string`

#### String Properties and Methods
- string.length => returns the length of the string
- string.slice(start, end)
- string.replace(toReplace, newString) => The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string
```js
let text = "Please visit Mcdonalds";
let newText = text.replace("Mcdonalds", "Dominos");
```
- string.toUpperCase() and string.toLowerCase()
- string.trim() => trims off leading and ending whitespaces

#### Template Strings
```js
let name = 'Gandumon';
let age = 1649;
console.log(`${name} is turning ${age} this year`);
``` 

### Reference types
- objects, arrays, functions

### Objects
- A JavaScript object is a collection of named values that have properties and methods to them
- They are declared inside `{}`
- Everything in js is an object except primitives

```js
let person = {firstName:'Suraj', lastName:'Das', age:69};
``` 

- The properties of an object can be accessed in 2 ways :- dot notation or squre bracket notation
- Use the dot notation in most cases as its more concise and compact and the square notation can be used when we don't know what property we are going to access in advanced (like when user selects a property)
- Note json is based on js objects and can be converted to and fro but keep in mind keys and strings must be in double quotes only (no single quotes allowed)
- To convert from object to json pass in the array of objects inside `JSON.stringify()`

```js
let person = {firstName:'Suraj', socialPoints:-90000};
// dot notation
person.socialPoints -= 42000;
person.judgement = "Labor Camp"; // will create a new property of judgement

// square bracket
let summary = person["firstName"] + ' will be given ' + person["judgement"];
let selection = 'firstName'; // user selects a property
person[selection] = 'Kalia';

//Converting to json
personJSON = JSON.stringify(person)
console.log(personJSON)
// in json format
/* person = {
    "firstName":"Suraj",
    "socialPoints":-90000
}
*/
```

## Equality comparisons and sameness
### Strict equality using `===`
- Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type.
- Strict equality is almost always the correct comparison operation to use.

### Loose equality using `==`
- Loose equality compares two values for equality after converting both values to a common type.
- undefined and null are loosely equal; that is, undefined == null is true, and null == undefined is true.

```js
if (1=='1') {
    console.log("1=='1'")
}

if (1==='1') {
    console.log("1==='1'")
}
/* Output
1=='1'
*/
```

### Arrays
- Arrays in js are dynamic in size and type of elements it can hold
- Its is made using `[]`
- An element can be accessed by its index, array[i]

```js
let favThings = ['blue', 'manga', 2];
favThings[0] = 'turqoise blue';
favThings[2] = [180, 360];
```
- Arrays are objects and hence have properties and methods to them
```js
console.log(favThings.length)
```

## Loops
### For loop
- Loops in js are a bit like in c/c++ I think
```js
for(initial value; condition till which the loop will iterate; increment) {
    statement;
}
```
```js
for(i = 0 ; i < 69; i++) {
  console.log(`loops are weird in js times ${i}`);
}
```

### While Loop
- While loop only takes in the condition till which to iterate
- remember to increment the initial value tho otherwise it will go on infinitly
```js
i = 0; 
while(i < 10) {
    console.log(i);
    i++
}
```

## Higher Order Array methods
- forEach, map, filter

### forEach 
- It is better to use this array method to iterate/traverse through an array than simply using a for/while loop
- The forEach method is called on the array and a callback function needs to be passed as the argument. This callback function handles/operates upon the incoming elements from the array.
- Multiple parameters can be passed to the callback fn but the first parameter must be the one that represents the incoming elements from the array
```js
const letters = ['r', 's', 't'];

letters.forEach( function(letter) {
    console.log(letter);
});
```

### Map
- Map returns the elements of an array
```js
let mappedLs = letters.map( function(letter) {
    return letter;
});
```

### Filter
- Filters and returns elements of an array according to a condition
```js
const letters = ['r', 's', 't', 3];

let filteredLs = letters.filter( function(letter) {
    return typeof(letter) == 'number';
});
console.log(filteredLs)
// output:- Array [ 3 ]
```

## Conditionals 
### If, else if, else
- If conditional can be nested in this order:- if (condition) {do}-> else if (condition) {do} -> else {do}
```js
let person = {firstName:'Suraj', socialPoints:-90000};
if (person.socialPoints < 0) {
    console.log("To the gulag you go ðŸ‘¿");
} else if (person.socialPoints >= 1000) {
    console.log("Keep up the good work citizen");
} else {
    console.log("Welcome to the mainland citizen")
}
```

### Ternary operator
- Shorthand if statement
- Used a lot to assign variables based on a condition
```js
let scoialScore = 200;
// ternary operator
let judge = (socialScore < 0) ? 'John Xina' : 'Randee Ortan'

console.log(judge)
// Randee Ortan
```
- let `variable` = `if condition` `?`(then) `value1` `:`(or) `value2`

### Switch
- Evaluates a variable or statement and has corresponding cases, if a case is true then its body is executed. A default case has to be there.
```js
let judge = (person.socialPoints < 0) ? 'John Xina' : 'Randee Ortan'

// Switches
switch(judge) {
    case 'John Xina':
        console.log('Why cant anybody see me?');
        break;
    default:
        console.log('Unga Bunga');
        break;
}
```

## Functions
- A piece of code that can be called multiple times from code. May or may not return a value
```js
function add5(num=9) {
    return num + 5;
}
// default value is 9 if no value is given
console.log(add5()); // 14
console.log(add5(12)); // 17
```

### Arrow functions
- Arrow functions are a handy way to write one liner functions.
```js
const addNums = (num1 ,num2) => num1 + num2
console.log(addNums(1, 3)) 
```

## OOP with js

## Function Constructors
- This is the outdated way to make classes (ES5)
- The identifier always start with a **capital letter**
- The variables that are needed to instantiate a class are passed as parameters to the function constructor
- The Classes' attributes can be defined by using the `this.<attribute>` keyword 
- The methods of the class can be defined both inside the function constructor or outside by using the objects'         `prototype` property
```js
// function constructor
function Person(firstName, lastName, dob, hobbies) {
    this.name = {'first':firstName, 
    'last':lastName
    };
    this.dob = new Date(dob); // year, month, date
    this.hobbies = hobbies;
}
Person.prototype.daysToLive = function () {
    return 80 - (2021 - this.dob.getFullYear());
}

let person1 = new Person('Kala', 'Kawua', '2001, 2, 4', ['singing', 'wrestling'])
console.log(`you have ${person1.daysToLive()} years to live`)
```

### Classes
- Classes were introduced in ES6 and work in the same way as many other languages
- a class is defined by the `class` keyword, the main syntax is something like:
```js
class nameOfTheClass {
    constructor(parameters, a, b, c,..) {
        this.attribute1 = a;
        this.attribute2 = [b, c];
        .
        .
    }
    someMethod(params) {
        do something;
    }
} 
example = nameOfTheClass(a, b, c,..)
example.someMethod(params)
```
- The constructor method of the class holds the attributes of the class
- Methods for the class can be defined in the class itself
- Example:
```js
// class
class Person{
    constructor (firstName, lastName, dob, hobbies){
        this.name = {'first':firstName, 
        'last':lastName
        };
        this.dob = new Date(dob); // year, month, date
        this.hobbies = hobbies;
    }
    daysToLive() {
        return 80 - (2021 - this.dob.getFullYear());
    }
    fullName() {
        return `${this.name.first} ${this.name.last}`
    }
}
```

>Note: The methods of the class are added to the prototype property of the class automatically

## The DOM
### The window
- A global variable, `window`, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.
- In a tabbed browser, each tab is represented by its own Window object; the global window seen by JavaScript code running within a given tab always represents the tab in which the code is running.
- The window object provides methods and properties that should be globally available to js

### Selectors
- To select elements from the document we need to call the singls/multiple selector methdos on the `document` object
- Single selector methods:
  - `document.getElementById()`: gets html element by its id
  - `document.querySelector()`: gets any single html element that matches search query. Pretty similar to jquery.
- Multiple selector methods:
  - `document.getElementsByClassName()`: Returns a html collection object of all elements with the given class, the object has to be converted to an array before using array methods on tho.
  - `document.querySelectorAll()`: Returns a node list of all matching elements, you can use array methods on it without any conversion.
```js
const listItems = document.querySelectorAll('.item');
listItems.forEach((item) => console.log(item.textContent))
```
>Note: Use `querySelector` & `querySelectorAll` most of the time
